     <h3>Global Sales by Genre and Platform</h3>
     <p>In terms of platform sales, PS2, released in 1994, had the all-time best global sales between 1980-2020. Other consoles that dominate the sales are the Xbox 360, Wii, DS, and PS. These platforms had doubled to tripled the amount of global sales compared to other consoles. As for genres, action, sports, and shooters appear to be the most popular. However, genre sales depend on when a platform was released. We can see that in older consoles, shooter games were not as common, but on new consoles like the Xbox 360, PS3, and PS4, they have skyrocketed. </p>

     <h3>Sales Over Time by Platform and Genre</h3>
     <p>This visualization shows global video game sales trends by platform and genre from 1980 to 2020. Sales grew steadily through the 1980s and 1990s before peaking between 2005 and 2010, driven by platforms such as the PS2, PS3, Wii, and Xbox 360. The PS2 achieved the highest total sales, later followed by a notable spike in PS4 sales around 2015. This highlights the commercial success of PlayStation consoles. In terms of genre, sales of Action and Shooter games increased from the 2000s onward, while Racing and Platform genres peaked earlier and have since declined. The connection between the graphs highlights how platform popularity drives the success of specific genres. For example, PlayStation platforms significantly boosted Action and Shooter game sales, while the Wii contributed to the rise of Sports games. This demonstrates a strong link between platform and genre trends.</p>

     <h3>Regional sales by Platform</h3>
     <p>The heatmap reveals clear regional preferences in platform sales. Overall, North America has the highest sales, led by the PS2, Wii, DS, and Xbox 360. Other PlayStation and Xbox consoles also performed well in this region. Europe follows a similar pattern, reflecting strong sales for PlayStation, Nintendo, and Xbox platforms. In contrast, Japan shows a preference for Nintendo consoles, particularly handheld devices, with the DS achieving the highest sales, followed by PlayStation systems, but Xbox platforms performed poorly. Other regions recorded much lower sales. However, the PS2, Wii, and DS continued to lead. In terms of global sales, PlayStation and Nintendo platforms demonstrated the most consistent success. The regional difference may be a reflection of gaming culture and preferences between the Western and Japanese markets. </p>

     <h3>Global sales of Nintendo Games Released by Genre (Over Time)</h3>
     <p>I was particularly interested in exploring Nintendo’s global sales and the genres of games they’ve released over time, because I have grown up playing many Nintendo games and owning their platforms. It’s also fascinating that Nintendo functions as both a platform creator and a game publisher, giving them unique control over how and when certain genres are developed. Since I already have a general understanding of Nintendo’s platform release timeline, it was interesting to see how console releases may have correlated with genre spikes. Nintendo’s global sales trends reveal that Sports and Platform genres have been the most successful over time, with the mid-2000s representing the company’s peak sales. One observation that stood out was that since the peak of Wii Sports, Nintendo hasn’t reached the same level of success within the sports genre.  Other genres, such as Racing, Action, and Role-Playing, contributed steadily but at lower levels, showing Nintendo’s broad but genre-specific strengths. </p>
